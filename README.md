## Classification Algorithms:
  - KNN:
  This file has the objective of displaying implementations of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, solving classification problems. By applying KNN - classifier predicts whether a person will have diabetes or not.  I am using jupyter-notebook to make it easier to visualize and understand the code implementations.
