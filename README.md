## Classification Algorithms:
  - KNN:
  This file has the objective of displaying implementations of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, solving classification problems. By applying KNN - classifier predicts whether a person will have diabetes or not.  I am using jupyter-notebook to make it easier to visualize and understand the code implementations. 
  
  - SVM:
  Used SVM to build and train a model using human cell records, and classify cells to whether the samples are benign or malignant.
  
  - Logistic Regression:
   The logistic Regression model is implemented to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not.
   
   - Naive Bayes classifier:
   Multinomial NB for text classification of news headlines  & Gaussian NB for wine dataset are implemented.
