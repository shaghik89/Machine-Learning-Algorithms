# Support-Vector-Machine (SVM)
SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is mostly used in classification problems.
SVM works by mapping data to a high-dimensional feature space so that data points can be categorized, 
However when the data are not linearly separable (This part done by kernel function of SVM classifier) still a separator between the categories are found.Then the data is transformed in such a way that the separator could be drawn as a hyperplane.


SVM applied to create and train a model using human cell records
Classify cells to whether the samples are benign or malignant
Linear Kernel type was chosen becuase here we implement linear SVM classifier.
