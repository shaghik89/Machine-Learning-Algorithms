# k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm

The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, supervised machine learning algorithm.
That can be used to solve both classification and regression problems. 
Major drawback is that it is becoming significantly slows as the size of that data in use grows.
KNN works by finding the distances between a query and all the examples in the data.


Then selecting the specified number examples (K) closest to the query, then votes for the most frequent label (in the case of classification)
or averages the labels (in the case of regression). We need to select the right K.
