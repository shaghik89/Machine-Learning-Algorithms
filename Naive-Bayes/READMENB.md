# Naive-Bayes-Classifier-Algorithm

- Naive Bayes Classifier is based on Bayes' Theorem which gives the conditional probability of an event A given B.
- NB is a supervised learning algorithm and it is used in classification algorithm like weather prediction, face recognition, news prediction, cancer or heart disease. 

## Introducing Bayes Theorem:
- Bayes' Theorem gives the conditional probability of an event A given another event B has occured. 
- So is it basically calculates the conditional probability of the occurance of an event based on the prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.
- Conditional Probabilty is the likelihood of an outcome occuring, with respect to previouse outcome occuring.
- Bayes' theorem allows you to update predicted probabilities of an event by incorporating new information.

The theorem is:

  ![equation](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?P(A|B)%3D%5Cfrac%7BP(B|A)P(A)%7D%7B{P(B)}%7D)  

To compute the right hand side of the equation you'll need to estimate the
prior, the likelihood, and the normalization.
